                    <h1>His Life & Paintings</h1>

                    <p>Vincent van Gogh, born in 1853 in Zundert, Holland, signed his works simply “Vincent” after receiving little recognition from his family as an artist. Despite his extraordinary talent, he sold only two paintings during his lifetime, often giving away his works, some of which were so undervalued that one was even used as a hen house door. He lived a turbulent life, supported financially and emotionally by his brother Theo, and was inspired by painting outdoors and capturing reality. His encounters with other artists in Montmartre, his move to Arles in search of sunlight, and his intense dedication to painting produced some of his most celebrated works, including Sunflowers, The Yellow House, and The Night Café.</p>
                    
                    <p>Van Gogh's time in Arles was prolific but also marked by mental health struggles, including the infamous ear incident during a visit from Paul Gauguin. He later admitted himself to the Saint Paul de Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he painted masterpieces such as Irises and Enclosed Field. His final months were spent in Auvers-sur-Oise under the care of Dr. Gachet, producing emotionally charged works like Wheatfield with Crows.</p>

                <h2>Gallery</h2>

                <p>Though largely unappreciated during his life, Van Gogh's art is now revered worldwide, with his Irises selling for a record $49 million in 1987. His legacy endures through his paintings, drawings, watercolors, and hundreds of letters, offering a profound insight into his relentless pursuit of beauty and truth in art.</p>
